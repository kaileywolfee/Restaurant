# CSCI115_ResponsiveWebDesignProject


In this assignment, you are to find a web site of one of your favorite restaurants that needs improvements. A good example would be http://www.senortequilacharleston.com/index.html (note: this is NOT one of my favorite restaurants!). Your job is to refactor the site into a modern, responsive web site.  The first step is to create a grid-based layout framework. This will be used to layout content on each page. This file will be called framework.css. You also must use @media queries or <link> tags to compensate for various  screen sizes. You can determine what size screens you support, but you must at least have three sizes, one for widescreen desktops, one for tablet-sized screens, and one for smartphone-sized screens (Pro-tip: You may want to also consider when tablets and smartphones are rotated to be viewed in Landscape mode).


Feel free to use images from their Foursquare & Yelp photo galleries to use on your website (or any ones that you used for your photography website that apply). You are free to use any website design you want (get ideas from restaurants that have well laid out sites). I am looking for an interesting navigation bar, logo/banner in top-left corner, and good use of a color scheme. 


This assignment is part of  your major Semester project. There are two (2) deliverables for this assignment.     
  1. A framework  for the grid-based layout, framework.css (Due. 14 Nov)
  2. Project files (all html,css, and image  files) (Due. 23 Nov)


Misc requirements:
